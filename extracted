Lactose intolerance
At birth, almost every infant produces enough lactase to 
digest the lactose in breast milk. The production of lactase 
decreases gradually after the age of 3 years. Lactose, a 
disaccharide, is split into 2 monosaccarides - glucose and 
galactose - by lactase in the small intestine. When lactase 
is not sufficiently produced, lactose will not be split in the 
small intestine. Instead, it will enter the large intestine (colon) 
mostly in an undigested form. The bacteria in the large 
intestine ferment the lactose, resulting in gas formation 
which can cause symptoms such as bloating and flatulence 
after lactose ingestion (Misselwitz, 2019). A proportion of the 
world’s population is able to tolerate lactose as they have 
a genetic variation that ensures they continue to produce 
sufficient quantities of the enzyme lactase after childhood. 
(Heyman, 2006; Schaafsma, 2008; Storhaug, 2017)
FIGURE 1  Normal situation and presentation in people with 
lactose intolerance 
Many Europeans and some populations
in Africa, the Middle East and 
Southeast Asia can digest lactose 
throughout life thanks to the presence
of the enzyme lactase in the small 
intestine. This is called lactase 
persistence. Most people who cannot 
tolerate lactose can digest a single 
dose of 12 gram of lactose per eating 
moment, experiencing little or no 
symptoms. This is equal to a large 
glass (about 250 ml) of milk. Yoghurt 
contains less lactose and semi-hard 
cheeses hardly contain any lactose.

intolerant. In Europe, this percentage is much lower and 25% 
of the population struggles to digest lactose in the intestines 
(Kranen, 2013). Caucasians have the unique characteristic 
of maintaining lactase activity throughout their lives. People 
from other ethnic backgrounds are genetically programmed 
to decrease or stop producing lactase after they have been 
weaned (Schaafsma, 2008).
Diagnosis 
Symptoms of lactose intolerance can include abdominal pain, 
feeling bloated, nausea, diarrhoea or flatulence caused by the 
amount of undigested lactose in the intestines. The diagnosis 
of lactose intolerance is usually determined using a hydrogen 
breath test. In people with a mild form of lactose intolerance, 
this is a good method that is non-invasive. You can also opt 
for a diagnostic lactose-restricted diet. If a positive effect is 
observed, the recommendation is to introduce lactose into the 
diet again in order to rule out the placebo effect of a lactose-
free diet and to confirm the diagnosis. (Heyman, 2006) A 
meta-analysis reveals that clinical symptoms (abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea) or self-reporting are not reliable indices for the 
diagnosis of lactose intolerance (Jellema et al., 2010).
Dietary advice
A lactose-restricted or lactose-free diet forms the basis of 
management for lactose intolerance. The degree of restriction 
depends on the quantity of lactose that a person can tolerate 
(Lomer, 2007; Montalto, 2006). Most people do not need 
to stop consuming milk or dairy products altogheter, since 
the majority are able to tolerate 12 grams of lactose as a 
single dose (EFSA, 2010; Heyman, 2006; Shaukat et al., 2010; 
Ugidos-Rodrigues, 2018). This equates to approximately one 
Types of lactose intolerance
A distinction is made between three forms of lactose intole-
rance: primary, secondary and hereditary. Primary lactose 
intolerance is the most common form. (Heyman, 2006) 
Primary lactose intolerance
Virtually every baby is born with enough lactase to digest 
the lactose in breast milk. Following the introduction of other 
foods, this lactase production gradually decreases in people 
with this form of lactose intolerance. It decreases so strongly 
that a lactase deficiency eventually occurs. The decreasing 
lactase production is caused by hereditary factors and - 
depending on ethnicity - takes place between the ages of 2 to 
20 years and does not always result in symptoms. A person is 
said to suffer from primary lactose intolerance if symptoms 
develop with normal dairy consumption of 1 to 3 glasses of 
milk per day. (Heyman, 2006; Schaafsma, 2008) 
Secondary lactose intolerance
Secondary or acquired lactose intolerance means that the 
person has a shortage of lactase due to damage to the 
intestinal mucosa. This damage can have various causes, 
namely:
•	 Infections such as gastro-enteritis, following radiotherapy 
or intestinal surgery, untreated coeliac disease, intestinal 
parasites or a virus (such as rotavirus)
•	 Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine following a 
resection of the small intestine or a stenosis
• 	A period of malnourishment
• 	The damaging effect of medication (such as antibiotics) or 
alcohol on the intestinal mucosa. 
The digestion of other disaccharides may also be affected in 
the presence of secondary lactose intolerance. In the case of 
damage to the intestinal wall, the lactase activity is the first 
to be affected and the last to recover. The lactase activity 
is usually fully or partially restored during recovery of the 
intestinal mucosa. (Heyman, 2006; Usai-Satta, 2022) 
Rare hereditary form
Thirdly, there is also a rare hereditary form of lactose intole-
rance (congenital lactase deficiency). In this case, lactase is 
absent from birth. The condition persists for life and occurs 
mainly in Finland. These people have a lactase activity of 
0-2% at birth, meaning that they also do not tolerate breast 
milk. This condition can be fatal without correct management.
Prevalence
Approximately two thirds of the world’s population is lactose

large glass (250 ml) of milk. According to the European Food 
Safety Authority, it is important to be certain that a person is 
lactose intolerant before deciding to eliminate milk and dairy 
products. After all, this can result in calcium and riboflavin 
(vitamin B2) deficiencies. (EFSA, 2010) Milk naturally contains 
essential nutrients that the body needs: proteins, vitamins 
B2 and B12 and minerals such as calcium. Fermented dairy 
products such as yoghurt, buttermilk and low-fat soft cheese 
often contain less lactose than milk. This is due to the fact 
that the lactic acid bacteria in these products have already 
broken down some of the lactose (Heyman, 2006). Lactase-
producing lactic acid bacteria are required for the production 
of yoghurt; they break down some of the lactose in the millk. 
Hard cheeses - such as Edam, Gouda, Maasdam or Cheddar - 
contain virtually no lactose (Schaafsma, 2008). Lactose-free 
dairy drinks are also an option. These drinks are available 
in most supermarkets and contain in general less than 0.1% 
lactose. If a diet including these products does not provide 
all the required nutrients, then nutrient-enriched products 
(including soy drinks) or supplements can be used to ensure 
a balanced diet. Pre- and probiotics may have a positive 
effect on lactose tolerance (Leis et al., 2020; Oak et al., 2018, 
Catanzaro et al., 2021; Ibrahim et al., 2021).

Important note 
Breastfeeding is the best nutrition for healthy growth and 
development of babies. Exclusive breastfeeding for six 
months is the optimal way of feeding infants. Thereafter 
infants should receive complementary foods with continued 
breastfeeding up to two years or beyond. Mothers should 
receive guidance on proper maternal nutrition in order to 
help sustain an adequate supply and quality of breast milk. 
Unnecessary introduction of bottle-feeding, partially or fully, 
or of other complementary foods and drinks may have a 
negative impact on breastfeeding, which may be irreversible. 
Mothers should consult their doctor and consider the social 
and financial implications before deciding to use breast 
milk substitutes or if they have difficulty breastfeeding. 
Usage, preparation and storage instructions of breast milk 
substitutes or of other complementary foods and drinks 
should be followed carefully as improper or unnecessary  
use may pose a health hazard.
